# Matrix Operations Toolbox 🧮💡

## Introduction
Welcome to the Matrix Operations Toolbox! 🚀 This C++ program is designed to perform a variety of operations on matrices, providing a versatile tool for matrix manipulation and analysis. Whether you're working with a single matrix or dealing with the interplay of two matrices, this toolbox has you covered.

## Features
- **Single Matrix Operations:**
  - Sum and difference calculation.
  - Determinant, transpose, and power calculations.
  - Inversion of a square matrix.
  - Row and column elimination.
  - Function application on the matrix.

- **Dual Matrix Operations:**
  - Addition and subtraction of matrices.
  - Matrix multiplication and commutativity check.
  - System of linear equations solution.
  - Displaying matrices.

## Usage
1. **Single Matrix Operations:**
   - Input the matrix dimensions and elements.
   - Choose the operation you want to perform.

2. **Dual Matrix Operations:**
   - Input dimensions and elements for both matrices.
   - Select the operation you want to carry out.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed.
2. Copy the provided code into a C++ file (e.g., `matrix_operations.cpp`).
3. Compile and run the program.
